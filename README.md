# Arduino Pin Socket Jig

I'm making some PCBs that use the Arduino Uno form factor. I'm planning to make a few of these PCBs, which means I need a lot of pin sockets for these PCBs. As they use the Arduino Uno form factor, that means we need four sets of pins. It's easy to make these from a single row 40-pin socket. But making a jig helps the process go a whole lot quicker.

This 3D-printable jig allows me to create the four required pin sockets for the regular Arduino Uno form factor, with 4 left over - that I happen to need for my board. You may not, but you can just throw them in a box as spares. I printed it using PETG because that's what happened to be loaded into my machine. You could also print this with PLA, TPU, ABS, or probably just about any other material you wish to use.

# How to use the Jig

It's a simple jig to use. Simply insert your 1x40 pin socket into the top, hold it in and pluck out the four pins from the bottom. You can use the gaps in the jig to help start your initial cut in the centre of each gap. Or, you can just pull the whole thing out and cut them afterwards. For a longer explanation, you can watch the video below.

These are the four pin sockets this jig is designed to help you create. You will have a 4-pin socket left over spare at the end of it.

The board I'm making is not Arduino-compatible, however, it follows the same form factor. This is mostly because there are 3 million Arduino cases and other accesories out there that still work, including plenty of 3D printed ones.

# Future Development

I doubt this will be updated. It does the job just fine. I might add other jigs for other form factors of board that need sockets of specific lengths. While you can just count, using a jig makes it easy to do without mistakes.
