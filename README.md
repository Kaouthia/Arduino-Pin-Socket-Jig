# Arduino Pin Socket Jig

I'm making some PCBs that use the Arduino Uno form factor. I'm planning to make a few of these PCBs, which means I need a lot of pin sockets for these PCBs. As they use the Arduino Uno form factor, that means we need four sets of pins.

* 1x10
* 1x8
* 1x8
* 1x6

It's easy to make these from a single row 40-pin socket. But making a jig helps the process go a whole lot quicker. This jig allows me to create the four required pin sockets for the regular Arduino Uno form factor, with 4 left over - that I happen to need for my board. You may not, but you can just throw them in a box as spares.
